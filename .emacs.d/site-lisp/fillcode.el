;;; fillcode.el --- Fillcode minor mode
;;
;; Fillcode
;; http://snarfed.org/fillcode
;; Ryan Barrett <fillcode@ryanb.org>
;;
;; This minor mode enhances the fill functions when in source code major modes,
;; such as c-mode, java-mode, and python-mode. Specifically, it provides a new
;; fill function that intelligently fills some parts of source code, like
;; function calls and definitions, if the language mode's fill function
;; doesn't already.
;;
;; M-x fillcode-mode toggles fillcode-mode on and off in the current buffer.
;;
;; This code is in the public domain.
;;
;; Changelog:
;; 0.9 2012/4/24:
;; - minor fix to allow byte compiling. no functional changes. (thanks Jonathan
;;   Tomer!)
;; 0.8 2011/9/6:
;; - bug fix: don't insert a space between the single equals operator and string
;;   literals, e.g. for python keyword arguments in functions
;; - bug fix: fix indentation for subsequent lines in indented blocks in python
;; 0.7.1 2007/08/24 (and before):
