Shelltris README:

Shelltris is my first attempt at writing a video game in a shell script.
It uses a small C helper, getch, which must be built for your operating
system.  The current CFLAGS in the Makefile are tuned for Mac OS X
(4-way "universal").  Tweak as needed, then do a "make".  The shell
script expects the getch file to be in the current directory.

Once you have built the helper, you can play the game by changing into
the shelltris directory and typing:

	./shelltris.sh

It will calibrate itself for a few second, then ask you to hit 'p' to play.

KEYS:
--------------------

,     - rotate counterclockwise
.     - rotate clockqise
z     - move left
x     - move right
space - move piece faster
q     - end the game immediately


--------------------
KNOWN ISSUES:
--------------------

* No high score support.
* Timing loops are highly sensitive to changes in CPU performance (a problem
  that is basically unavoidable, unfortunately).
* In spite of attempts to calibrate the timers, there is still more
  variation from machine to machine than I would like.
* The script must execute itself several times with different flags to do
  calibration.  This means that the path to the script must be hard-coded
  within the script itself.  It is currently hard-coded to assume the
  script is in the current directory.
* This has not been tested except in Mac OS X.  While it should work in
  other OSes, I make no guarantees.


--------------------
PERFORMANCE:
--------------------

For maximum performance on slower machines, I recommend using Mac OS X v10.5
over previous versions.  Terminal 2.0 seems to be dramatically faster than
previous versions (on the same hardware) for every drawing test I've tried.
Your mileage may vary.
