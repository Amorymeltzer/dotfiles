Shellitaire README:

I wrote Shellitaire because I knew the other games I'm working on
will take too long to finish, and I wanted a second game.

I started working on this Tuesday night.  It took four evenings
and a few mintues each on three mornings to work up the drawing
code.  Writing the actual game code and debugging took a day.

Enjoy.


--------------------
KEYS:
--------------------

q - quit

space or return - select cards to move or choose their destination
escape - cancel selection

f - flip deck (3 at a time)
o - flip deck (1 at a time)

i - increase depth of selection
m - decrease depth of selection
j - move selection position left
k - move selection position right


When selecting the source card or cards, the position skips any
empty stacks automatically.  When selecting the destination,
it skips the discard pile automatically, and if you are moving
more than one card, it also skips the ace stacks.
