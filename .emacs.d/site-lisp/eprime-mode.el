;; * About eprime-mode
;;
;; An E-prime checking mode for Emacs. 
;; Read more here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-prime.
;; Naturally, all of this file that can, conforms to E'.
;;
;; Adds the following functionality: 
;;
;;   - M-x eprime-check-buffer to check the buffer
;; 
;;   - A minor mode, eprime-mode, which checks the buffer and
;;     any text you enter thereafter.
;; 
;;   - M-x eprime-remove corrections to remove its corrections
;; 
;;   - Customisable face for banned words. eprime-banned-words-face
;; 
;;   - M-x eprime-check-word to check only the current word
;;
;;   - Can customise banned words (by pushing onto eprime-baned-words)
;;
;;   - Default different face than FlySpell for ease of use together
