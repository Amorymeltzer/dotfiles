;;; Commentary:

;; This global minor mode highlights escape sequences in strings and
;; other kinds of literals with `font-lock-regexp-grouping-backslash'
;; face when appropriate.

;; It currently supports `ruby-mode' and both main JavaScript modes.

;; To enable it elsewhere, customize `hes-simple-modes'.

;; Put this in the init file:
;;
;; (hes-mode)
