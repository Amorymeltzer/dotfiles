# Flycheck

<https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/syntax-checks.html>

Todo list:

- [x] `global-flycheck-mode` or just `prog-mode-hook` and `text-mode-hook`?  Try former?
  - [x] `(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)`
- [x] Basic customizations
  - [x] Keybindings
	- [x] Maybe take over flymake commands?
  - [x] Learn to use it!
	- [x] <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/error-list.html>
	- [x] <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/error-reports.html>
	- [x] <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/syntax-checkers.html>
  - [x] Customize-group, etc.
  - [x] Faces?  Copy flymake, or start over fresh, using whatever the theme picks up?  Split the difference?
  - [x] Consider turning margin on?  Big change for everybody but maybe worth it long-term?
  - [x] Consider whether to include stuff in custom or init file
	- If custom, easier (no buffer-local, etc.) but nicer/cleaner if init?
- [x] Language-specific stuff <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html>
  - For each, check:
	- Correct program found and working; Maybe: <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/syntax-checkers.html>
	- Turns on and runs automatically
	- Modeline works
	- Not too slow
	- Other customizations

	- [x] js: <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#javascript>

	- [x] markdown: <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#markdown>
	- [x] perl: <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#perl>
	  - [x] perlcritic
	  - [x] perltidy as well? (perltidyrc) Does that even make sense?  Doesn't seem possible, no "dry run" or "report only" options AFAICT
	- [x] php: <https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#php>
	  - Requires a linter, not installed ATM

- [x] Other extensions/packages:
  - [x] flycheck-aspell (Nah - flyspell good enough, possibly even preferable, despite (slight) lagtime when typing.  Should look into [flycheck-correct](https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct), though)
  - [x] flycheck-color-mode-line (also above) (Not unless/until customizing mode line differently/better)
